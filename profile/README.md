## Welcome to the Lab4Code organization

**Lab4Code** is a small (and hungry) dev team from **South Tyrol (Alto Adige)**. We build tools, integrations, and small systems that remove busywork and make your daily workflows feel effortless.

We care about one thing above everything else: **shipping useful software** that saves real time for real people.

## About Us

We’re two students from South Tyrol who love:

* building practical products
* polishing UX until it feels “obvious”
* refactoring messy code into something solid and maintainable

We’re not here to collect half-finished repos. We’re here to build a company around **reliable, well-designed software** that people actually want to use.

### Our Mission

Help individuals and teams **get more done with less friction** by:

* automating boring steps
* connecting tools that don’t talk to each other
* turning manual workflows into one-click flows

---

## What We Build

**We build software that:**

* saves time (not “nice-to-have”, but measurable)
* reduces complexity (fewer steps, fewer mistakes)
* integrates into tools people already use (like Notion and more)

If a workflow feels like “copy/paste hell,” we want to kill it.

## Projects

### Project 1: [PersonalNotionManager](https://github.com/Lab4Code/PersonalNotionManager)

A user-friendly way to **import and consolidate data into Notion** from different platforms (e.g., Steam, IMDb, and more). Built as an open-source **T3-Stack** project, focused on making data organization simple and scalable.

### Project 2: [camera-roll-formater](https://github.com/Lab4Code/camera-roll-formater)

A simple tool to **bring your media files in order**—because messy camera rolls and chaotic folders waste time.

You can find more on our [GitHub organization page](https://github.com/Lab4Code).

## Contributing

We love contributions—especially if you care about clean code and good UX.

**How to contribute:**

1. Fork the repo you want to improve
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-change`
4. Make your changes (and test them)
5. Push to your fork: `git push origin feature/my-change`
6. Open a Pull Request to the original repo

If you’re new to open source: open a PR anyway. We’ll give feedback and help you get it merged.
